# What is Advent of Code?
(From the [website](https://adventofcode.com/2021/about)) <br/>
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

# Why do I want to participate in AOC?
At first, I was just mostly curious. But now, I realized I wanted to strengthen my python skills as I am really in love with the syntax of the language. My college has mostly taught me languages in Java and C++. I think it's good to learn these languages first, but once you understand how it's truly implemented, I believe using Python will fasten up the process.

In short, I want to code better in Python :)

# Do you do this by yourself?
I will try to do all the challenges all by myself, but it seems difficult at certain days so I need to learn from others. I will cite the source of anything that is not made by me and explain what I learned from the code I learnt. I can say for sure that this has been an amazing learning experience.
